msgid " There is no way to check if audio is truly lossless if you do not have the original file\n\nOne way to determine this is by looking at the spectrogram of the file and finding the cutoff.\n\n\nSome audio files have a lower cutoff frequency, but this doesn't mean they're not lossless.\n\nThis program compares the spectrogram of your audio file to a fake \"lossless\" version.\n\nIf there's a difference, the audio file is likely lossless.\n\nMost used highest friequencies are also displayed, if these values match you are probably dealing with fake lossless compression.\n\n\nUse the \"Compare audio with its fake resolution\" option for this. You can limit the audio to 45 seconds for faster processing.\n\n\n!!Please note that changing the bitrate to lower settings won't show you if the audio is truly lossless!!\n\n\nYou can play both the original and the lower-quality audio and save the lower-quality audio as an MP3 file.\n\nYou can play the difference between those two (+- What you are missing by compressing the audio)\n\n\nYou can also view the spectrogram of a single file using the \"Open spectrogram for one file\" option.\n\n\n\n\n        "
